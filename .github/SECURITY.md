## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email us at [dylarcher@gmail.com](mailto:dylarcher@gmail.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Advisories

We will issue security advisories for any confirmed vulnerabilities. These will be published via GitHub Security Advisories.

## Our Commitment

**We will:**

- &hellip;investigate all reported vulnerabilities promptly.
- &hellip;work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability.
- &hellip;take appropriate action to address the vulnerability.
- &hellip;publicly disclose the vulnerability once a fix is available, unless there is a compelling reason not to.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

This security policy is a living document and may be updated over time.
